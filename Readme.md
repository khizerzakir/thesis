🚀 **Thrilled to Announce the Completion of My Master's Thesis!** 🎓

After months of dedication and hard work, I'm excited to share that I've successfully completed my master's thesis titled *"Riemannian Networks for Remote Sensing Time Series Classification Using Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices."*

### 🌍 **Abstract Overview**:
In this study, I explored the use of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices on the Riemannian manifold to classify multivariate remote sensing time series data. Remote sensing time series were represented as covariance matrices, capturing both the statistical dependencies and temporal dynamics crucial for accurate classification.

### 🧠 **Key Contributions**:
- **LogEucResNet (LERN):** A second-order, geometry-aware neural network designed specifically for crop classification tasks. Drawing inspiration from successful brain signal representations (such as M/EEG), LERN leverages differential geometry and linear algebra to embed covariance matrices onto the Riemannian manifold, facilitating the extraction of latent features essential for classification.
  
- **LERN-Combo:** A novel fusion variant introduced in this study that integrates spectral and temporal sub-models. This approach enhances classification accuracy by simultaneously capturing both spectral and temporal patterns, significantly outperforming other variants on benchmark datasets like MiniTimeMatch and BreizhCrops.

### 📊 **Key Findings**:
The results underscore the effectiveness of second-order statistical representations in capturing intricate dependencies within time series data. LERN-Combo and LERN-Temp variants demonstrated superior performance, achieving higher macro-F1 scores compared to LERN-Spec, proving the robustness of this Riemannian manifold-based approach.

### 🌟 **Impact**:
This research paves the way for new directions in non-linear learning of SPD matrices within deep models, offering innovative solutions for exploiting the geometric properties of data. It marks a significant contribution to the digital earth observation domain, advancing remote sensing classification tasks through a novel Riemannian network architecture.

### 🙏 **Acknowledgments**:
A huge thank you to my advisors, mentors, and peers who supported me throughout this journey. Your guidance and encouragement have been invaluable.

As I close this chapter, I look forward to exploring new opportunities where I can apply and expand on these findings. Excited for what’s next!
